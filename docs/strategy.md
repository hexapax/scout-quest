# Scout Quest — Strategy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-22

## Vision

Scout Quest is an AI-assisted system that helps Boy Scouts accomplish goals, satisfy requirements, and learn how to use AI as an enabling tool — not a crutch. The AI assistant guides, reminds, researches, and keeps scouts accountable, but never does the work for them.

The project started as a tool for one troop, but the ideas behind it have broader potential. Agentic-led pedagogy — AI that teaches by enabling rather than answering — could reshape how young people interact with AI at a formative age. Scouting has spent over a century formalizing how to build values and character in youth. Combining that institutional knowledge with AI assistants is a powerful opportunity.

## Why This Matters

### For My Troop (Immediate)
- Proof of concept that works with real scouts on real merit badge requirements
- Help the troop survive and keep functioning — volunteers are stretched thin
- Make the bureaucracy of requirements, tracking, and communication less painful
- Give scouts a reason to engage with AI in a bounded, productive way

### For Scouting (Medium-term)
- Scouting America struggles to attract and retain volunteers because there are too many rules to follow and enforce, and people don't have time for it
- The scout-guide assistant and the scouter (adult volunteer) assistant could reduce friction and help the whole organization work better
- Safety controls (YPT compliance, transparent communications, parent CC on all emails) are hard to enforce across a national organization of volunteers — an AI system can make compliance automatic rather than burdensome
- Advancement tracking synced from Scoutbook reduces manual data entry and gives scouts and parents real-time visibility

### For Education Broadly (Long-term)
- If this works, it's worth taking to Scouting America, the Atlanta Area Council executive, or the headmaster of Pace Academy
- AI assistants will become a part of these children's lives — we should be intentional about how they're introduced
- Teaching through AI means reimagining pedagogy: the AI is a coach, not a tutor that gives answers
- The bounded scope of the "quest" is a feature — it gives scouts a reason to use the assistant while constraining what the assistant will do

## Core Principles

1. **Enable, don't do.** The AI helps scouts accomplish their goals. It reminds, guides, researches, and celebrates progress. It never writes the budget, composes the email, or fills in the requirement for them.

2. **Bounded scope.** The assistant has a narrow focus — the quest (Personal Management and Family Life merit badges via a savings goal). This gives scouts a clear reason to engage while preventing open-ended AI usage. The scope can expand over time.

3. **Transparent and safe.** All communications are visible to parents. Emails always CC the parent/guardian (YPT compliance). The system makes safety automatic, not something volunteers have to remember to enforce.

4. **Powered by real data.** Scout profiles, advancement, and troop rosters come from Scoutbook — the official BSA system. The AI works with accurate, current data rather than manual entry.

5. **Character and values.** The AI adopts a character persona calibrated per scout. Tone, vocabulary, and intensity are tuned to the individual. The character system is designed to build engagement over the 13-week quest without being cringey or patronizing.

6. **Reduce volunteer burden.** Scouters (adult volunteers) get their own assistant that helps with monitoring, coaching, and administration. The system handles compliance automatically so volunteers can focus on mentoring.

## Target Audiences

| Audience | Assistant | Value |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Scouts** (11-17) | Scout Coach | Daily quest engagement, advancement tracking, merit badge guidance |
| **Parents/Guardians** | Scout Guide | Monitor progress, set up quests, see advancement, coordinate with counselors |
| **Scouters** (adult volunteers) | Scout Guide (expanded) | Reduce admin burden, automate compliance, monitor troop health |
| **Merit Badge Counselors** | (future) | Track which scouts are working on what, communicate safely |

## What We're Proving

The prototype was very effective with individual scouts. The open questions are:

1. **Consistency** — Can the tooling produce results that are consistent over the long term, across different scouts and interaction styles?
2. **Closing the loop** — Can agents verify their own functionality, catch technical issues, and self-correct?
3. **Scale** — Does the system work for a full troop (15-30 scouts), not just one-on-one?
4. **Data integration** — Does Scoutbook sync give us enough data to make the experience seamless?
5. **Volunteer adoption** — Will busy volunteer leaders actually use the guide/scouter assistant?

## Strategic Next Steps

1. Get Scoutbook sync fully working — this unlocks the entire roster and advancement data
2. Close the testing loop — agents need to be able to verify the system works end-to-end
3. Run with 2-3 scouts from the troop as a pilot
4. If it works, prepare a demo for the Atlanta Area Council or Scouting America
5. Document the pedagogy approach for broader audiences (Pace Academy, education conferences)
